/** The client-approved destination detail page.
 *
 * The template is written around Canada with sample content: named partner
 * universities, QS ranks, per-programme-level tuition tables, six invented
 * "why" cards, a five-step IRCC visa walkthrough, city rent bands, graduate
 * salary tables, ad slots and a blog rail. Universta stores none of that.
 *
 * What it does store is a structured country profile -- cost, work rights,
 * language requirements, an intake calendar and statistics, each with its own
 * source reference and verification date -- plus real universities, courses,
 * scholarships and cities scoped to the country. So each template section is
 * rendered from the matching profile, and a section with no backing record is
 * dropped rather than filled in: no rankings, no salary table, no per-level
 * tuition breakdown, no ad slots, no blog rail.
 *
 * The jump nav is built from the sections that actually rendered, so it can
 * never link to an anchor that is not on the page. */

              varies by university and programme, intake windows and deadlines

              choice against the published sources shown above and the
